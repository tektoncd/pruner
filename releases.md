# Tekton Pruner Releases

## Release Frequency

Tekton Pruner follows the Tekton community
[release policy](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/releases.md)
as follows:

- Versions are numbered according to semantic versioning: `vX.Y.Z`
- A new release is produced on a monthly basis, when enough content is available
- Four releases a year are chosen for
  [long term support (LTS)](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/releases.md#support-policy).
  All remaining releases are supported for approximately 1 month (until the
  next release is produced)
  - LTS releases take place in January, April, July and October every year
  - Releases usually happen towards the middle of the month, but the exact date
    may vary, depending on week-ends and readiness

## Release Process

Tekton Pruner releases are made of YAML manifests and container images.
Manifests are published to cloud object-storage as well as
[GitHub](https://github.com/tektoncd/pruner/releases). Container images are
signed by [Sigstore](https://sigstore.dev) via
[Tekton Chains](https://github.com/tektoncd/chains); signatures can be verified
through the
[public key](https://github.com/tektoncd/chains/blob/main/tekton.pub) hosted by
the Tekton Chains project.
